# VRCBilliards Community Edition 2

This is (or, rather, will be) the **full rewrite** of the [VRCBCE] project, the leading billiards table in the VR social app [VRChat].

Currently this project contains the bleeding-edge 1.6.0 release version of the basic pool table, stored here to avoid interfering with the main repo.

This project is a community effort to provide the best, easiest to use and easiest to maintain game prefab in VRC.

## Goals

This project is currently in the prototyping phase.

This project's short-term goal is a functioning implementation of American 8-Ball.

The project's mid-term goal will seek general feature parity with [VRCBCE]. There are some features of VRCBCE that will not be ported: these will be noted on this repository.

The project's long-term goals are to add new game types and support a more accurate and stable physics system.

## Current Status

The improved physics system, allowing for the cue ball to jump and improved accuracy and reliability across the board (including in high-pop instances) has been implemented.
This is likely to be the final feature shipped in 1.6.0, meaning this can be considered the bleeding-edge 1.6.0 version for the time being.
