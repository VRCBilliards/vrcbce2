# VRCBilliards Community Edition 2


This is the **full rewrite** of the [VRCBCE] project, the leading billiards table in the VR social app [VRChat].

This project is a community effort to provide the best, easiest to use and easiest to maintain game prefab in VRC.

This project is developed [live on Twitch]! 

## Goals

This project is currently in the prototyping phase.

This project's short-term goal is a functioning implementation of American 8-Ball.

The project's mid-term goal will seek general feature parity with [VRCBCE]. There are some features of VRCBCE that will not be ported: these will be noted on this repository.

The project's long-term goals are to add new game types and support a more accurate and stable physics system.
